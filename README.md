### My Experience using tailwind css
- Honestly, I didn't mind it. It was really confusing to set up and figure out at first, but as I was started to get the hang of the website and where to put everything, it became easier. I think I still prefer normal css compared to tailwind just because I can set it up in no time, but tailwind is definitely a cool concept.
